# Getting Started with MCP Desktop Gateway

This guide shows practical examples of what you can accomplish with the MCP Desktop Gateway in Claude Desktop.

## Installation

First, install the gateway globally:

```bash
npm install -g @bobmatnyc/mcp-desktop-gateway
```

Then configure Claude Desktop to use the gateway. You can do this automatically with our install script:

```bash
# Download and run the configuration script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobmatnyc/mcp-desktop-gateway/main/scripts/install-claude-config.sh | bash
```

Or manually add it to your Claude Desktop configuration in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-desktop-gateway": {
      "command": "mcp-desktop-gateway"
    }
  }
}
```

The install script will:
- ‚úÖ Verify the gateway is installed
- ‚úÖ Backup your existing Claude config
- ‚úÖ Add/update the MCP server configuration
- ‚úÖ Validate the JSON configuration
- ‚úÖ Test the gateway functionality

## Tips for Best Results

### üéØ Be Specific
Instead of: *"Send a message"*  
Try: *"Send a text message to Sarah saying 'Meeting moved to 3 PM'"*

### üîó Chain Actions
Instead of multiple separate requests:  
Try: *"Open my project folder, run git status, and start the development server"*

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety First
The gateway includes built-in safety features:
- Command validation and filtering
- Timeout protection
- Secure execution environment
- Permission-based access control

### üîÑ Combine Tools
Mix different connector capabilities:
```
"Create a project status report:
1. Get git status from my development folder
2. Take a screenshot of my current Safari tab
3. Send a summary message to my team
4. Save the report to my Documents folder"
```

## Available Connectors

| Connector | Description | Platform |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Shell** | Execute commands, file operations, system info | All |
| **AppleScript** | macOS app automation (Safari, Contacts, Messages, Finder) | macOS |
| **Gateway Utils** | Connector management, system diagnostics | All |
| **Hello World** | Testing and examples | All |

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway Not Responding
```
"Check the status of all MCP connectors"
"Restart the gateway service"
"Show me the gateway logs"
```

### Permission Issues
```
"List available tools and their permissions"
"Check if I have access to run shell commands"

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Tools**: Ask *"What tools are available?"* to see all capabilities
2. **Check Resources**: Use *"Show me available resources"* for system information
3. **Get Help**: Request *"Show me the gateway documentation"* for detailed guides
4. **Custom Scripts**: Create your own automation scripts in the user-scripts directory

## Security Notes

- All commands are validated before execution
- Dangerous operations require explicit confirmation
- File access is controlled and logged
- Network operations are monitored

The MCP Desktop Gateway provides a secure, powerful bridge between Claude and your desktop environment. Start with simple commands and gradually build more complex automation workflows as you become comfortable with the system.
